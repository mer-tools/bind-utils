      <listitem>

	  via <command>dnssec-validation auto;</command> or
	  <command>dnssec-lookaside auto;</command>), revoking

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  A flaw in delegation handling could be exploited to put
	  <command>named</command> into an infinite loop, in which
	  each lookup of a name server triggered additional lookups
	  of more name servers.  This has been addressed by placing
	  limits on the number of levels of recursion
	  <command>named</command> will allow (default 7), and
	  on the number of queries that it will send before
	  terminating a recursive query (default 50).
	</para>
	<para>
	  The recursion depth limit is configured via the
	  <option>max-recursion-depth</option> option, and the query limit
	  via the <option>max-recursion-queries</option> option.

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Two separate problems were identified in BIND's GeoIP code that
	  could lead to an assertion failure. One was triggered by use of
	  both IPv4 and IPv6 address families, the other by referencing
	  a GeoIP database in <filename>named.conf</filename> which was
	  not installed. Both are covered by CVE-2014-8680. [RT #37672]
	  [RT #37679]
	</para>
	<para>
	  A less serious security flaw was also found in GeoIP: changes
	  to the <command>geoip-directory</command> option in
	  <filename>named.conf</filename> were ignored when running
	  <command>rndc reconfig</command>. In theory, this could allow
	  <command>named</command> to allow access to unintended clients.

	  New quotas have been added to limit the queries that are
	  sent by recursive resolvers to authoritative servers
	  experiencing denial-of-service attacks. When configured,
	  these options can both reduce the harm done to authoritative
	  servers and also avoid the resource exhaustion that can be
	  experienced by recursives when they are being used as a
	  vehicle for such an attack.
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      <option>fetches-per-server</option> limits the number of
	      simultaneous queries that can be sent to any single
	      authoritative server.  The configured value is a starting
	      point; it is automatically adjusted downward if the server is
	      partially or completely non-responsive. The algorithm used to
	      adjust the quota can be configured via the
	      <option>fetch-quota-params</option> option.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      <option>fetches-per-zone</option> limits the number of
	      simultaneous queries that can be sent for names within a

	      value is not self-tuning.)
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	<para>
	  Statistics counters have also been added to track the number
	  of queries affected by these quotas.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  New statistics counters have been added to track traffic
	  sizes, as specified in RSSAC002.  Query and response
	  message sizes are broken up into ranges of histogram buckets:
	  TCP and UDP queries of size 0-15, 16-31, ..., 272-288, and 288+,
	  and TCP and UDP responses of size 0-15, 16-31, ..., 4080-4095,
	  and 4096+.  These values can be accessed via the XML and JSON
	  statistics channels at, for example,
	  <ulink url="http://localhost:8888/xml/v3/traffic"
		  >http://localhost:8888/xml/v3/traffic</ulink>

	  The serial number of a dynamically updatable zone can
	  now be set using
	  <command>rndc signing -serial <replaceable>number</replaceable> <replaceable>zonename</replaceable></command>.
	  This is particularly useful with <option>inline-signing</option>
	  zones that have been reset.  Setting the serial number to a value
	  larger than that on the slaves will trigger an AXFR-style
	  transfer.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  When answering recursive queries, SERVFAIL responses can now be
	  cached by the server for a limited time; subsequent queries for
	  the same query name and type will return another SERVFAIL until
	  the cache times out.  This reduces the frequency of retries
	  when a query is persistently failing, which can be a burden
	  on recursive serviers.  The SERVFAIL cache timeout is controlled
	  by <option>servfail-ttl</option>, which defaults to 10 seconds
	  and has an upper limit of 30.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  The new <command>rndc nta</command> command can now be used to
	  set a "negative trust anchor" (NTA), disabling DNSSEC validation for
	  a specific domain; this can be used when responses from a domain
	  are known to be failing validation due to administrative error
	  rather than because of a spoofing attack. NTAs are strictly
	  temporary; by default they expire after one hour, but can be
	  configured to last up to one week.  The default NTA lifetime
	  can be changed by setting the <option>nta-lifetime</option> in
	  <filename>named.conf</filename>. When added, NTAs are stored in a
	  file (<filename><replaceable>viewname</replaceable>.nta</filename>)
	  in order to persist across restarts of the <command>named</command> server.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  The EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) option is now supported for
	  authoritative servers; if a query contains an ECS option then
	  ACLs containing <option>geoip</option> or <option>ecs</option>
	  elements can match against the the address encoded in the option.
	  This can be used to select a view for a query, so that different
	  answers can be provided depending on the client network.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  The EDNS EXPIRE option has been implemented on the client

	  correctly when transferring zone data from another slave
	  server.

	  The rate limiter configured by the

	  in use", and 2) by attempting to acquire a lock on a file
	  specified by the <option>lock-file</option> option or
	  the <command>-X</command> command line option.  The

	  this does not edit <filename>named.conf</filename>; the zone

	  Added server-side support for pipelined TCP queries.  Clients

	  The <command>nxdomain-redirect</command> option specifies

	  name. This allows NXDOMAIN redirection data to be supplied
	  by multiple zones configured on the server or by recursive

	  a single <command>type redirect</command> zone, has
	  better average performance but is less flexible.) [RT #37989]

	  NXDOMAIN responses to queries of type DS are now cached separately
